# 🚨 Issue: SocketBox State Separation Problem - Method Call Clone State Loss

**Priority**: 🔥 **HIGH** - Critical for HTTP Server functionality  
**Impact**: Phase 9 HTTP server implementation blocked by state management failure  
**Status**: Ready for immediate investigation  

## 📋 **Problem Summary**

SocketBox state changes are lost between method calls due to improper clone state synchronization. Each method call creates a new clone instance, causing state mutations to be isolated and not reflected back to the original variable.

**Core Issue**: `bind()` successfully sets `isServer = true` on Socket ID=36, but subsequent `isServer()` call creates Socket ID=51 clone and reads `false`.

## 🎯 **Root Cause Analysis Completed**

### ✅ **Confirmed Working Components**
- SocketBox creation: `new SocketBox()` ✅
- Method execution: All methods (bind, toString, isServer, close) execute without deadlock ✅  
- Arc reference sharing: Proper Arc<Mutex> sharing within single method ✅

### ❌ **Identified Core Problem**
```bash
# Evidence from execution logs:
toString(): Socket ID = 17, Arc ptr = 0x560a2455e300
isServer(): Socket ID = 26, Arc ptr = 0x560a2455e600  # Different Arc!
bind():     Socket ID = 36, Arc ptr = 0x560a2455e600  # State change applied here
isServer(): Socket ID = 51, Arc ptr = 0x560a2455e600  # New clone, state lost
```

**Problem Pattern**: Method call resolution creates new clones without proper state back-propagation to original variable.

## 🧪 **Complete Reproduction Test Cases**

### **Test 1: State Persistence Failure**
```bash
# Command
./target/release/nyash test_socket_state_preservation.nyash

# Current Result (BROKEN):
[Console LOG] Before bind: isServer = false
[Console LOG] Bind result = true  
[Console LOG] After bind: isServer = false  # ❌ Should be true
Result: FAIL: State preservation broken

# Expected Result (FIXED):
[Console LOG] After bind: isServer = true   # ✅ State preserved
Result: PASS: State preservation works
```

### **Test 2: Clone ID Analysis**
```bash
# Command  
./target/release/nyash test_socketbox_fix_validation.nyash

# Current Evidence:
🔥 SOCKETBOX DEBUG: bind() called - Socket ID = 36
🔥 AFTER MUTATION: is_server value = true    # ✅ State set correctly
🔥 SOCKETBOX DEBUG: isServer() called - Socket ID = 51  # ❌ Different ID!
🔥 IS_SERVER READ: is_server value = false  # ❌ Reading wrong instance
```

### **Test 3: Other Boxes Comparison**
```bash
# Command
./target/release/nyash test_other_boxes_working.nyash

# Result: All other Box types work correctly
[Console LOG] ✅ ArrayBox正常: size=1
[Console LOG] ✅ MapBox正常: value=test_value  
[Console LOG] 🎉 他のBox全て正常動作: 4件成功
```

## 🔍 **Technical Analysis Required**

### **Primary Hypothesis**
The issue lies in the **clone state synchronization mechanism** during method resolution:

```rust
// Problem area (suspected):
// Method resolution creates new clones but doesn't sync state back
if let Some(socket_box) = obj_value.as_any().downcast_ref::<SocketBox>() {
    let result = self.execute_socket_method(socket_box, method, arguments)?;
    // State changes in socket_box clone not propagated back to original
}
```

### **Investigation Focus Areas**
1. **Clone Back-propagation**: How method results update original variables
2. **Arc Reference Management**: State container sharing vs instance isolation  
3. **SocketBox vs Other Boxes**: Why other Box types maintain state correctly
4. **Method Resolution Pipeline**: Clone creation and state synchronization timing

### **Architecture Comparison**
```rust
// Working Boxes (maintain state):
ArrayBox.push() → state change → ✅ reflects in original variable
MapBox.set()    → state change → ✅ reflects in original variable

// Broken Box (loses state):  
SocketBox.bind() → state change → ❌ lost in clone, not in original
```

## 📊 **Required Investigation Approach**

### **NO Band-aid Fixes Allowed**
- **NO** symptom-only patches
- **NO** guesswork solutions without root cause analysis
- **NO** incomplete testing - all test cases must pass

### **Systematic Analysis Required**
1. **Method Resolution Analysis**: How clones are created and managed during method calls
2. **State Sync Architecture**: Mechanism for propagating clone changes back to variables  
3. **Comparative Study**: Why ArrayBox/MapBox work but SocketBox doesn't
4. **Arc<Mutex> Pattern**: Proper state container sharing implementation

## ✅ **Success Criteria - All Must Pass**

### **Must Achieve**
```bash
# Basic state preservation
local socket = new SocketBox()
local result = socket.bind("127.0.0.1", 8080)
local isServer = socket.isServer()  
# isServer.equals(true) == true  ✅

# Field-based state preservation  
me.server = new SocketBox()
me.server.bind("127.0.0.1", 8080)
local status = me.server.isServer()
# status.equals(true) == true  ✅

# Multiple method calls maintain state
socket.bind("127.0.0.1", 8080)    # Set state
socket.toString()                  # Access state  
socket.isServer()                  # Must still return true ✅
```

### **Validation Required**
```bash
# All existing tests must pass
./target/release/nyash test_socket_state_preservation.nyash  
# Expected: PASS: State preservation works

./target/release/nyash test_socketbox_fix_validation.nyash
# Expected: isServer() after bind returns true

./target/release/nyash test_other_boxes_working.nyash
# Expected: Continue working (regression check)
```
