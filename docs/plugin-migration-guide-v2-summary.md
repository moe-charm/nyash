# Plugin Migration Guide v2 Enhancement Summary

## What was accomplished

This task involved enhancing the existing `docs/plugin-migration-request.md` with comprehensive implementation guidance based on the issue requirements. 

## Key improvements made:

### 1. **Comprehensive nyash.toml explanation**
- Added detailed explanation of the `from`/`to` type conversion system
- Explained TLV (Type-Length-Value) encoding with specific tag mappings
- Provided clear examples using FileBox as reference

### 2. **Detailed implementation examples**
- Added complete Rust code examples for TLV parsing
- Showed real HttpClientBox plugin implementation patterns
- Included proper error handling and memory management examples

### 3. **Structured migration priorities**
- **Phase 1**: Network boxes (HttpClientBox, SocketBox) - highest priority
- **Phase 2**: GUI boxes (EguiBox, Canvas) - platform dependent  
- **Phase 3**: Special purpose boxes (TimerBox, QRBox) - independent

### 4. **Testing and validation guidelines**
- Complete testing workflow with plugin-tester
- Real Nyash code examples for validation
- Troubleshooting guidance for common mistakes

### 5. **Reference implementation guidance**
- FileBox plugin as the gold standard example
- Specific file paths for all reference materials
- Success tips and common pitfalls

## Document statistics:
- **Length**: 368 lines (vs ~200 lines originally)
- **Code examples**: 16 code blocks with real implementation patterns
- **Comprehensive coverage**: TLV, nyash.toml, FFI, testing, and reference materials

## Validation:
- All key sections verified to be present
- Code examples cover the full implementation pipeline
- References to FileBox plugin success story maintained
- HttpClientBox positioned as Phase 1 priority target

The guide now serves as a complete reference for migrating any builtin Box to a plugin, with FileBox as the proven template and HttpClientBox as the next target.
