Failure Details:
❌ Interpreter error: Invalid operation: birth() method not yet implemented for builtin box 'FileBox'

The error occurs when trying to create a LoggingFileBox that delegates from FileBox.
The test expects to use birth() constructor but FileBox (as a plugin) doesn't implement it yet.

This suggests the plugin system is working correctly (FileBox is recognized), but the 
birth() constructor delegation for plugin boxes needs implementation.
